## Introduction

**Blockchain** is yet another crucial part of the ["Industrial Revolution 4.0"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0). Blockchain was invented by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2018. However The original work that led to the creation of the Blockchain was started in 1991 by Staurt Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. This technology has significant implications for the way we live and do business today.

## What is a Blockchain?

> **Blockchain is a continuous list of records(blocks) which are linked and secured by cryptography. -[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)**

## Advantages of the Blockchain

1. **Enhanced Security**: Blockchain is secure because it uses the powerful sha256 cryptographic algorithm. This makes it almost impossible to penetrate, hence securing transactions on the Blockchain.

2. **Increased Efficiency and Speed**: Since transaction bypass third parties and long beaurocracies, it is faster and more efficient to transact on a Blockchain than other traditional platforms.

3. **Reduced Cost**: You don't pay money to middlemen when transacting on a blockchain. This significantly reduce cost of doing business on the Blockchain.

4. **Improved Traceability**: Blockchain enable people to trace the entire journey of a product in the supply chain from source to the final destination.

5. **Increase Trust**: Blockchain inspires trust among parties transacting on the chain because everyone has a copy of the genuine document of the transaction which cannot be easily tempered with.

## Practical Application of the Blockchain

1. **Healthcare**: Blockchain is use to deliver drugs and health products securely. This help avoid fraud in the delivery of medical products.

2. **Energy**: Electricity trading is an innovative way to use Blockchain to sell and buy excess and reduce shortage of power respectively. This has added economic benefits to people.

3. **Law**: Blockchain has enabled the secured storage of legal documents like contracts for safe keeping and prevented unlawful document tempering.

4. **Governement**: Blockchain has helped to reduce bureaucracies in government by allowing real-time document access and update to all institutions at the same time.

5. **Defense**: Attacks and modification of critical defense resources like operating and computer systems can result in loss of lives. The Blockchain distributed system can be used to house these resources at different locations, hence safeguarding them.

## Types of Blockchain

1. **Public Blockchain**: is a permissionless and open blockchain that allow everyone to participate and benefit from it. Bitcoin cryptocurrecy is an example of a public blockchain.

2. **Private Blockchain**: is a permissioned and closed blockchain where only people with the right credentials can participate and benefit from it.

3. **Hybrid Blockchain**: is a blockchain which is partly permissioned and partly permissionless. It builds on the draw backs of the Public and Private Blockchains

## Key Terms

**Ledger**: is a list of transactions on a blockchain.

**Bitcoin**: a digital currency that utilizes the blockchain to facilitate financial transactions.

**Distributed Network**: allows information to be spread out across many users(nodes).

**Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: is a consensus protocol that protects the blockchain system from fraud(mining-wise).

**Mempool**: is the waiting place for all unconfirmed transactions before they are added to the blockchain.

**Consensus**: refers to how the network reaches agreement about which transactions are most trustworthy.

**Proof of Work**: is a system where information can be costly to produce but easy to verify.

**Proof of Stack**: seeks to achieve consensus by giving votes to people with stakes in the system.

**Hash value**: is a digital fingerprint for information.

```py
     block data + nonce = Hash value
```

**Hashing function**: maps a group of data to a unique hash value.

**Block**: is a container that holds a list of transactions to be added to the blockchain.

**Genesis Block**: is the first block in the chain. it has no previous hash. Its hash never changes.

**Block difficulty**: is the number of zeros needed to mine a block(guess a block's hash value).

**Block size**: is the amount od space a block has to hold data.

**Merkle Root**: is a hash that represent every transaction in the blockchain.

**Mining**: means changing the nonce of a block.

### Transactions on a Blockchain

**Identity**: is a unique identifier for an entity on the blockchain.

**Wallet address**: a unique identifier for wallet.

**Private Key**: is a secret key that allows you spend the bitcoin in your wallet.

**Public Key**: is a sharable key for recieving bitcoin from others.

**Signature**: establishes proof of ownership for each transaction on the blockchain.
