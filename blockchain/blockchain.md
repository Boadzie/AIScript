2. **Increased Efficiency and Speed**: Since transaction bypass third parties and long beaurocracies, it is faster and more efficient to transact on a Blockchain than other traditional paltforms.

3. **Reduced Cost**: You don't pay money to middlemen when transacting on a blockchain. This significantly reduce cost of doing business on the Blockchain.

### Practical Application of the Blockchain

1. **Healthcare**: Blockchain is use to deliver drugs and health products securely. This help avoid fraud in the delivery of medical products.

2. **Energy**: Electricity trading is an innovative way to use Blockchain to sell and buy access and reduce shortage power respectively. This has added economic benefits to people.
