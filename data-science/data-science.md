## Introduction

---

**Data Science** is among the new technologies that make the ["Industrial Revolution 4.0"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0). It has become a crucial part of every company and every successful economy. Billion of dollars are up for grab in the data economy. In fact Data Science is called the ["sexiest job of the 21st Century"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2014/01/21/data-scientist-sexiest-job-of-the-century/#1ebdf15a674b). The reasons for the data hype are numerous; they include;

1. **[Data Deluge](http://science.psu.edu/sciencejournaldec2012/archives/june-2016/features/data-deluge)**: Huge volumes of data in all forms (text, videos, images, etc) are generated daily. All these data need to be analyzed to gain valuable insight for decision-making.

2. **[Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)**: The computing power required to process these huge data volumes are now possible due to advancement in computing devices and storage. For example GPU and TPU have significantly reduced the time needed to run some algorithm that usually take way longer before these technologies were created.

## What is Data Science?

**Data Science involves the activity of analyzing large and usually messy datasets in order to extract knowledge and insight for decision-making.**

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field of study that includes maths, computer science, etc.

## Skills that make a Great Data Scientist

The following are the required skills tha makes a great data scientist;

### Soft Skills

1. **Curiosity**: Data Science involves uncovering knowledge and insight buried deep in messy. This means that to excel as a Data Scientist, you must learn to embrace your curiosity and explore options.

2. **Problem-Soving**: Data Scientist are problem-solvers. They use insights from data to solve real world problems.

3. **Communication Skills**: The ability to communicate insight in a clear way for non-technical people to understand is crucial to the success of any Data Scientist.

4. **People Skills**: Data Scientist rarely work alone. As such, the ability work well with other people is important for any data scientist to master if they will get far.

5. **Critical Thinking**: The ability to analyze siuations/solutions/problems and select the most viable from alternatives as well as continually eveluate the solution so as to make incremental changes is required for anyone who want to be a Data Scientist

### Technical Skills

---

1. **Coding (Python/R/etc.)**: Coding is an essential part of the skillset of Data Scientist. Python and R are the most popular languages used in Data Science. Python has many tools that makes the work of a Data Scientist easy. Examples include Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.

2. **SQL**: Databases are the primary storage of most of our data. It therefore crucial that you learn to write sql queries to retrieve data from datanbases.

3. **Big Data**: Large volumes of data requires large processing capacity. That is why technologies like Hadoop, Apache Spark were created to handle these huge data with its attributes.

4. **Machine Learning**: Machine Learning is a crucial part of Data Science. Machine Learn is the ability to make computers learn from data. Deep learning a subset of machine learning is responsible for all the cool we see today like self-driving cars and chatbots.

5. **Data Visualization**: Data communication through visualization is also important in the toolset of a Data Scientist. After all, if you can't communicate your results to non-technical people, how will would your work benefit them?

6. **Domain Knowledge**: Knowledge and intuition about the field in which you are working is also important in the accurate analysis of Data Science results and subsequent business applications.
