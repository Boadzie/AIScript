## Introduction

---

**Data Science** is among the new technologies that make the ["Industrial Revolution 4.0"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0). It has become a crucial part of every company and every successful economy. Billion of dollars are up for grab in the data economy. In fact Data Science is called the ["sexiest job of the 21st Century"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2014/01/21/data-scientist-sexiest-job-of-the-century/#1ebdf15a674b). The reasons for the data hype are numerous; they include;

1. **[Data Deluge](http://science.psu.edu/sciencejournaldec2012/archives/june-2016/features/data-deluge)**: Huge volumes of data in all forms (text, videos, images, etc) are generated daily. All these data need to be analyzed to gain valuable insight for decision-making.

2. **[Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)**: The computing power required to process these huge data volumes are now possible due to advancement in computing devices and storage. For example GPU and TPU has significantly reduced the time needed to run some algorithm that usually take way longer before these technologies were created.

## What is Data Science?

**Data Science involves the activity of analyzing large and usually messy datasets in order to extract knowledge and insight for decision-making.**
