Being created in the image of God means you possess to a certain degree, the qualities of God including the ability to Design. Learning the principles of design enable you to nurture and develop your inner Design.

## Principles of Design

1. **Design is Design(not decoration)**: Design is not just how it looks, _it is also how it works (- Steve Jobs)_. Throwing paint on a screen is not design, it's just throwing paint on the screen :). Design is the functioning of a system and how pleasant it is to use the system.

6.**Design is Problem-Solving**: Design is solving real-world problem and making live easier for your users.

7. **Design is Inclusive(Accessibility)**: Design is including the needs of all your users when designing the system.

8. **Design is Consistency**: All elements in a system should be consistent. Fonts, aligmnents, colors, typography, etc should be consist in a digital product.
